# Installing Mods in Project Vanguard

Project Vanguard mods are of two types: they are either a `.rb` file or a `zip`.

If the mod is a standalone `.rb` file, just drop the file in the game's `Mods` directory.

If the mod is a `zip`, decompress the `zip` and drop its contents in the game's main directory (it is equivalent to the process you do when patching your game).

> Before reporting any bugs in Project Vanguard's Discord, be sure that the bug is not caused by one of the mods and contact the mod's author if that is the case.
